            <p>WARNING! The documentation has not been properly updated for the latest quite major refactoring. It does
                not at the moment properly document Nanning.</p>

            <p>There is now a blog/wiki for Nanning located at
                <a href="http://nanning.snipsnap.org">http://nanning.snipsnap.org</a>. It's based on
                <a href="http://snipsnap.org">SnipSnap</a>.</p>

            <p>We're occasinally hanging out at the Werken IRC server. Connect a suitable IRC-client to <tt>irc.werken.com</tt>
               channel <tt>#nanning</tt>.</p>

            <p>Nanning Aspects is a simple yet scaleable aspect-oriented framework for Java.</p>

            <p>Nanning is also nice "little" town in Guanxi province in southern China. It's about 1-2
                million inhabitants which barely makes it a town by chinese standards. It is not to be
                confused with the much larger Nanking/Nanjing.</p>
