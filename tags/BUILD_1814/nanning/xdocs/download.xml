                <b>Note!</b>
                Due to complications in the build-process the latest release (0.9) is only available through
                the maven-repository at Codehaus. If you want to have a more traditional distribution available
                for 0.9 please contact the
                <a href="mail-lists.html">mailing lists</a> and we will provide one
                as soon as possible.

            <p>
            If you're using Maven to build a project that depends on Nanning, you
            should tell maven to use Codehaus' repository in addition to the one at
            Ibiblio. Put the follwing in your project's project.properties file:
            </p>
            <pre>maven.repo.remote = http://www.ibiblio.org/maven/,http://dist.codehaus.org/</pre>
