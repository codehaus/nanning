            <p>Nanning Aspects is a simple yet scaleable aspect-oriented framework for Java.</p>

            <p>Nanning is also nice "little" town in Guanxi province in southern China. It's about 1-2
                million inhabitants which barely qualifies it as a town by chinese standards. It is not to be
                confused with the much larger Nanking/Nanjing.</p>

                <a href="http://nanning.snipsnap.org">http://nanning.snipsnap.org</a>. It's an ongoing effort.</p>
