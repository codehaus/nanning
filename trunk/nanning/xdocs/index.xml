                Nanning is a simple yet scaleable aspect-oriented framework based on the ideas of
                implementing AOP in Java outlined by Rickard Öberg in his
                <a href="http://dreambean.com">blog</a>.

            <p>
                Nanning is also nice "little" town in Guanxi province in southern China. It's about 1-2
                million inhabitants which barely makes it a town by chinese standards. It is not to be
                confused with the much larger Nanking/Nanjing.
